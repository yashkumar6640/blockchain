1. I will write all the quesries which needs to be triggered when the page is loading. 
	this is basically UUID + Step function
	1. IF the response what u get is blank --> You need to enable click submit button (USer should be able to submit)
	2. If you get the response (not a blank response) --> Submit button should be disabled --> load the values which you have got in the response 

2. On click of UUID --> you need to show  a template (tabular comlum) 
	sl no, Event time,Event type and action (admin - hardcoded)
